>
> **What I Do:**

> *   **I Tell Stories with Data:** My side projects (like *Year in Review*) explore how we can reclaim our memories from corporate algorithms, turning raw data into personal narratives.
>
> My design process is simple: **Respect the User's Agency.** Whether it's a warehouse worker in Jakarta or a traveler fearing price hikes, I build tools that empower, not manipulate.

*   **Tech:** React, Firebase, Tailwind
*   **Key Feature:** "Sing Along" mode to bypass anxiety centers in the brain.

Dynamic pricing makes users feel helpless. "Price Lock" is a button that pauses inflation for 24 hours, giving travelers peace of mind while they wait for approval.

*AR Commerce experiment*
An AR experiment to solve the "Realness Gap" in online shopping. If a user can "wear" a product via a filter, they trust it.
