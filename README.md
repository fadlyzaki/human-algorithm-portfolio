# The Human Algorithm: System Architecture v2.8

> **Engineering Philosophy**: "Chaos contained within a grid."

This repository houses the source code for [fadlyzaki.com](https://fadlyzaki.com)—a high-performance, single-page application (SPA) architected to demonstrate the intersection of **Computer Science logic** and **Human-Centered Design**.

## 🏗 Architectural Decisions

As a **Design Engineer**, I treat this portfolio not just as a gallery, but as a production-grade product. Every technology choice balances **Creative Expression** (WebGL, Framer Motion) with **Engineering Rigor** (Performance, Accessibility, Type Safety).

### 1. The Core Engine: React 18 + Vite
*   **Decision**: Migrated from CRA to Vite for O(1) HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and optimized Rollup builds.
*   **Benefit**: Sub-second dev server constraints allow for rapid prototyping of complex physics interactions without friction.
*   **Design Pattern**: Strict differentiation between `Logic Layer` (Custom Hooks) and `View Layer` (Components).

### 2. Physics & Interaction: Framer Motion
*   **Decision**: Used `framer-motion` over CSS transitions for state-driven physics (springs, drag constraints).
*   **Rationale**: The "Human Algorithm" requires interfaces that feel organic, not linear. Spring physics mimic the natural resistance and elasticity of real-world objects, reinforcing the "Tactile" UX pillar.

### 3. Vision System: MediaPipe (Client-Side AI)
*   **Decision**: Implemented `HandCursorOverlay` using Google's MediaPipe on the Edge (Client-Side).
*   **Privacy-First**: No video data is ever sent to a server. Inference happens locally in the browser's WASM runtime.
*   **Performance**: Lazy-loaded via dynamic imports to ensure the vision model doesn't block the main thread's First Contentful Paint (FCP).

### 4. Localization: Context-Driven Internationalization
*   **Architecture**: A lightweight `LanguageContext` provider wrapping the application root.
*   **Optimization**: Translations are stored in a centralized `translations.js` data structure, enabling instant O(1) lookup without network waterfalls common in CMS-based i18n solutions.

## ⚡ Performance Strategy

We optimize for **Cognitive Load** (User) and **Computational Load** (Device).

*   **Code Splitting**: Route-level splitting via `React.lazy()` ensures users only download the code for the page they are viewing.
*   **Asset Optimization**: All assets (WebP) served via Vercel's Global Edge Network.
*   **Defensive Rendering**: `ErrorBoundary` wraps critical subsystems (like the 3D Profile Scanner) to gracefully downgrade to static content on low-power devices.

## 🚀 Deployment Protocol

### Local Development
Standardized `npm` scripts for developer experience (DX).

```bash
# 1. Clone & Install
git clone https://github.com/fadlyzaki/human-algorithm-portfolio.git
npm install

# 2. Ignite Dev Server
npm run dev

# 3. Compile Production Build
npm run build
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
*   **Trigger**: Push to `main`.
*   **Runner**: Vercel Build Pipeline.
*   **Checks**: Linting -> Build -> Asset Optimization -> Edge Distribution.

## 🛡 Security & Privacy

*   **Client-Side "Encryption"**: Sensitive case studies use a simulated decryption layer. Authentication is logic-based, not server-based, ensuring zero server-side attack surface for personal data.
*   **No PII Collection**: The application is stateless and collects no Personally Identifiable Information beyond standard anonymous analytics.
