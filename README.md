# Human Algorithm :: The Portfolio System v2.1

> **"I don't chase chaos—I contain it."**

A high-performance, narrative-driven portfolio system built for **Fadly Uzzaki (Product Designer & Systems Specialist)**. This platform is architected as an "Interactive Manifesto," bridging Computer Science rigor with human-centered resilience.

## 🛠 Strategic Core

This system is engineered for **speed, modularity, and cognitive efficiency**. It prioritizes "Design for Recovery" over cosmetic delight, utilizing an industrial-cyberpunk aesthetic to tell a story of technical excellence and emotional truth.

- **Stack**: React (Vite) + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion.
- **SSOT (Single Source of Truth)**: Centralized data architecture in `portfolioData.js` driving all views.
- **ATS Optimization**: Specialized "System Manifest" built for high-performance HR parsing.
- **SEO Resilience**: Integrated static HTML fallbacks to ensure metadata and introductory content are indexed even without JS execution.

## 🛰 System Information Architecture

### 1. The Priority-First Homepage
Reorganized into a 5-tier logical sequence designed for maximum narrative impact:
1. **Hero**: Strategic positioning and identity.
2. **Side Projects**: Experimental "Wild Creativity" playground.
3. **Work**: Validated industrial ecosystems (Lumina, GudangAda, Stoqo).
4. **About Me**: Personality synthesis and system history.
5. **Notes**: Professional logs and intellectual logs.

### 2. System Manifest (ATS-Friendly CV)
A high-density technical specification sheet optimized for both human scanners and automated systems.
- **Dynamic Sync**: Projects, timelines, and outcomes mirror the main portfolio data.
- **Compact Header**: Horizontal contact block minimizing vertical friction.
- **Standardized Semantics**: Uses HRD-friendly terminology for zero-friction parsing.

### 3. Decryption Lens (Webcam Interaction)
A custom interaction layer using **MediaPipe Hands** that translates gesture input into a global CSS mask, revealing hidden system layers. Includes robust failsafes and accessibility overrides.

### 4. Semantic Memory Module (The Agent)
An experimental simulated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) module that replaces static bios with an interactive CLI-style query system.

## 🚀 Execution & Deployment

### Local Uplink
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development terminal
npm run dev

# Compile production build
npm run build
```

### Production Standards
- **Global Radius**: Strict **8px** (`rounded-lg`) industrial standard.
- **Design System**: Atomic theme injection via `ThemeContext` (Dark/Light modes).
- **Interactions**: All components audited against Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics. Navbars standardized for constant visibility.
