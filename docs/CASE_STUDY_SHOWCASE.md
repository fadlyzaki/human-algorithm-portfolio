# Dribbble & Behance Showcase: The Human Algorithm Portfolio

## 1. Project Overview
*   **Title**: The Human Algorithm: A Cyber-Industrial Portfolio
*   **Tagline**: "I don't chase chaos. I contain it."
*   **Concept**: An interactive "System Manifest" that bridges the gap between raw computer science (The Void) and human emotional complexity (The User).
*   **Live Link**: [Your Portfolio URL]

## 2. The Narrative (Copy for Decoration)
> "In a world of templated uniformity, **The Human Algorithm** is a rebellion. It treats the portfolio not as a gallery, but as a Terminal—a direct line to the designer's operating system. Built with React, Framer Motion, and a disregard for standard components, it features a draggable physical interface, decryptable case studies, and a 'Void' mode that respects the user's cognitive load."

## 3. Visual Flows (For Video/GIFs)

### Flow A: The "Contain Chaos" Opening
1.  **Start**: Dark screen with subtle grid lines (`opacity: 0.1`).
2.  **Action**: Text scrambles into view: "Human By Design".
3.  **Hero**: The ID Card falls onto the screen with a heavy thud (physics animation).
4.  **Interaction**: Cursor drifts over the card; holographic sheen follows the mouse.

### Flow B: Adaptive Summaries (The "Persona Toggle")
1.  **Context**: A locked Case Study screen.
2.  **Action**: User clicks "ELI5" tab.
3.  **Result**: Text morphs into simple, friendly language. ("Big spreadsheets are hard...")
4.  **Action**: User clicks "Technical" tab.
5.  **Result**: Text rewrites itself into system architecture jargon. ("React Context API...")
6.  **Highlight**: Show the seamless transition without page reload.

### Flow C: The Decryption Lens (Hand Tracking)
1.  **Context**: "Access Denied" overlay on a project.
2.  **Action**: User activates "Gesture Mode".
3.  **Visual**: A green "Targeting Reticle" appears, tracking the user's actual hand via webcam.
4.  **Interaction**: User performs a "Pinch" gesture over the lock.
5.  **Payoff**: The lock shatters/dissolves, revealing the content.

### Flow D: The "Void" Switch (Theme Toggle)
1.  **Start**: Light Mode (Clean, industrial, crisp).
2.  **Action**: Click the Sun/Moon toggle.
3.  **Result**: The screen inverts. The background becomes deep black (`#0a0a0a`). Grid lines glow faintly. The ID card becomes a dark security badge.

## 4. Key Screens (Static Shots)

### Shot 1: The Command Center (Home)
*   **Focus**: Top 50% of the homepage.
*   **Elements**: 
    *   The "Running Ticker" at the top (Status updates).
    *   The massive typographic header.
    *   The floating/draggable ID card.
    *   **Caption**: "A navigational HUD for the modern recruiter."

### Shot 2: Airy Technical Diagrams
*   **Focus**: The Project Cards (e.g., Workforce or Commerce headers).
*   **Elements**:
    *   The translucent, glass-morphism panels.
    *   The connecting lines (nodes) between UI elements.
    *   The "System Architecture" visible underneath the UI.
    *   **Caption**: "Visualizing the unseen logic behind the interface."

### Shot 3: The Archive (Side Projects)
*   **Focus**: The Grid Layout of side projects.
*   **Elements**:
    *   The raw, brutalist list view.
    *   The "Rare Ruby Found!" treasure notification popping up.
    *   **Caption**: "A repository of failed experiments and weekend hacks."

### Shot 4: Mobile Control Deck
*   **Focus**: Mobile View mockup.
*   **Elements**:
    *   The floating bottom pill navigation (`Grid | ArrowUp`).
    *   Thumb-friendly touch targets.
    *   **Caption**: "Industrial design, pocket-sized."

## 5. Technical Callouts (For the "Geeks")
*   **Stack**: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS
*   **Physics**: Framer Motion (Draggable elements)
*   **AI**: MediaPipe (Hand Tracking)
*   **Data**: JSON-driven "Single Source of Truth" for CV and Portfolio.

## 6. Social Media Captions

**Option 1 (Professional)**
"Excited to share my new portfolio: The Human Algorithm. It's an exploration of 'Digital Resilience'—building systems that can withstand chaos. Features include an adaptive reading engine that rewrites content based on who you are (Recruiter vs. Developer) and a built-in hand-tracking navigation system. Built with React & Framer Motion. 🧢"

**Option 2 (Edgy/Creative)**
"Templates are boring. So I built a Terminal. Introducing my new site—a 'System Manifest' for my design work. It has physics, hidden treasures, and a 'Decryption Lens' that lets you unlock case studies with hand gestures. Welcome to the Void. ⚫️"
