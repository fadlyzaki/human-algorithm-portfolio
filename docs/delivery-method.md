# Overview

👨🏻‍🎨*Let's step into the shoes of a small business owner for a moment to understand their daily challenges*👨🏻‍🎨

Imagine you're running a bustling 24-hour food business in the heart of the city. Every single morning, while most people are still sleeping, you navigate through the quiet streets on your motorcycle to reach the wet market between 4-6 am. Rain or shine, this daily journey is an unavoidable part of your routine - carefully selecting fresh ingredients and essential stocks that will keep your business running smoothly throughout the day. This time-consuming process has become your daily ritual, though not necessarily by choice.

One ordinary afternoon, while you're busy managing your store, a field salesman visits your establishment and introduces you to STOQO. The salesman's professional demeanor, combined with STOQO's competitive pricing structure, catches your attention. After careful consideration, you decide to give STOQO's service a try, hoping it might finally free you from those early morning market runs. Initially, everything runs smoothly - the quality meets your standards, the prices are fair, and deliveries arrive as promised. However, your optimism is suddenly challenged when you begin experiencing late deliveries, forcing you to return to your old routine of early morning market visits, disrupting your carefully planned schedule and affecting your entire day's operations.

**Context about STOQO's Delivery Operations:**  

STOQO operates a sophisticated dual-delivery system tailored to different product categories. The first category, Fresh goods, primarily consists of perishable items like vegetables and fresh produce, which are delivered during the crucial early morning window from dawn until 11 am to ensure maximum freshness. The second category, Dry goods, encompasses essential household items known as "Sembako" - including staples like rice, bottled water, and other non-perishable commodities - which are scheduled for afternoon delivery between 2 pm and 4 pm. To maintain operational efficiency and ensure next-day delivery service, STOQO implements a strict cut-off time of 7 pm for all orders.

### 🕵🏻‍♂️ Research

Our Product Management team identified a concerning trend in our data analytics: an increasing frequency of delivery-related complaints. While initial internal discussions led us to hypothesize that these issues stemmed primarily from operational challenges, we recognized that we lacked comprehensive understanding of the customer perspective. Despite our ongoing efforts to address operational inefficiencies, we needed deeper insights into how these delivery challenges were affecting our customers' daily business operations. In my role as the product designer leading this initiative, I implemented a comprehensive research strategy combining both **contextual interviews** and detailed **field studies** to gain first-hand observations of how our delivery service integrated into our customers' daily routines and business operations.

The research planning phase was methodically structured to ensure meaningful results. I developed a detailed sampling strategy to identify and select research participants, carefully cross-referencing delivery incident reports with customer satisfaction ratings to ensure we captured a representative range of experiences. To maintain research rigor, I developed a comprehensive interview protocol that underwent thorough review with the Product Manager, ensuring we would capture all critical aspects of the delivery experience while allowing for organic discovery of unexpected insights.

Field Study

Initially, I planned to conduct an extensive study involving 8 outlets that had experienced delivery issues. However, to ensure depth and quality of insights, I ultimately focused on conducting comprehensive interviews with 5 carefully selected business owners. These in-depth conversations allowed us to thoroughly explore their experiences, challenges, and specific pain points related to delivery timing. To complement these direct customer insights, I also organized detailed feedback sessions with our Field Activators (FA) and Salesmen. These sessions proved invaluable as FAs and Salesmen serve as crucial touchpoints in our customer relationship, handling day-to-day purchasing interactions and addressing immediate concerns. Their unique perspective helped bridge the gap between customer experiences and operational realities, providing a more holistic understanding of the delivery ecosystem.

This testimonial perfectly encapsulates the real-world impact of delivery delays on our customers' business operations, highlighting the urgent need for improvement in our delivery timing consistency.

### 🔍 Analysis

After dedicating a week to comprehensive research, I began the meticulous process of synthesizing and analyzing the collected qualitative data. My analytical approach involved carefully categorizing and examining the various issues identified through both in-depth customer interviews and detailed feedback sessions with our Sales team. To ensure a thorough understanding of user behavior patterns, I utilized multiple indicators including user responses, observed actions, and valuable feedback from our Field Agents (FA) and Sales representatives. 

These indicators helped us evaluate three critical aspects of the customer experience: awareness levels, satisfaction rates, and anxiety thresholds. I then created a detailed temporal mapping of these experiences, organizing them according to the sequential progression of delivery times that our users encounter throughout their journey (as illustrated in the accompanying visualization).

Through our detailed analysis, we identified four significant and recurring pain points that consistently emerged in our users' delivery experiences:

1. Drivers arriving ahead of schedule, causing disruption to customers' preparation routines and daily operations
2. Customers experiencing uncertainty regarding the anticipated arrival time of their goods, leading to difficulties in planning their business activities
3. Customers requiring more transparent communication about potential delivery delays to better manage their inventory and operations
4. Customers lacking real-time awareness of driver arrival times, resulting in missed deliveries and operational inefficiencies

Following this comprehensive analysis, I organized a presentation of our research findings to key stakeholders directly involved in delivery operations, including the Head of Operations, Head of Sales, and CTO. To facilitate collaborative problem-solving, we extended invitations to these stakeholders to participate in solution-oriented brainstorming sessions based on our findings.

### 💡 Ideation

To facilitate the ideation process, I employed design thinking methodology and organized an intensive collaborative workshop. This structured approach allowed us to systematically explore potential solutions while keeping our research findings at the forefront of our discussions. I carefully crafted "How Might We" (HMW) Questions that directly corresponded to the key insights we uncovered during our research phase, ensuring our ideation remained focused on addressing real user pain points.

The main HMW question that guided our workshop was:

<aside>
❓ **How might we manage user anxiety due to risk exposure from uncertain delivery time?**

</aside>

To make this challenge more actionable, we broke down the main question into two specific areas of focus that we believed would directly address customer needs:

1. How do we **set** expectations of delivery time to customers so they can prepare themselves to receive the delivery, ensuring they have clarity from the moment they place their order?
2. How do we **maintain** expectations of delivery time to customers so they can prepare themselves to receive the delivery, keeping them informed throughout the entire delivery process?

Solutions from Brainstorming 

### 📣 Solution and Design

During our ideation session, the team explored numerous solutions to address the delivery-related challenges. After thorough deliberation and voting, we selected a comprehensive **delivery status tracking system with real-time in-app push notifications** as our primary solution to address customer concerns.

The product team then focused on transforming this concept into a concrete, implementable system that would integrate with our existing infrastructure.

Here are the solutions:

1. **Show comprehensive delivery status tracking**
A detailed status system that informs customers at every delivery stage, from order confirmation to final delivery. This includes status indicators, estimated preparation times, and delivery progress updates.
2. **Implement intelligent push notification system**
A notification framework that delivers timely updates through the mobile app, including order confirmations, preparation updates, dispatch notifications, and delivery alerts.
3. Enable Sales team to resolve delivery concerns through a dedicated support interface for quick issue resolution
4. Implement real-time ETA calculations and live location tracking for accurate delivery timing
5. Provide secure driver contact information for direct communication when needed
6. Use SMS and WhatsApp communications to ensure delivery updates reach customers even when they're not using the app

**Technical Context:** Previously, STOQO operated separate systems—a driver-focused mobile application for operations teams and distinct customer-facing applications. These systems worked independently, creating information silos that limited transparency. We undertook the task of unifying these systems to create seamless information flow between delivery operations and customer interfaces. This integration now allows us to provide customers with comprehensive delivery tracking features through their application, including precise ETAs, status updates, and live progress monitoring.

For the initial phase, we focused on the first two solutions to establish a strong foundation for the delivery tracking system, as seen below in designs.

Usability Testing Session

### 📣 User and Design Feedback

Following the completion of the high-fidelity design phase, I implemented a comprehensive feedback gathering process. This involved conducting detailed usability testing sessions over a three-day period to collect immediate user reactions and insights. The testing sessions were structured to evaluate both the functionality and intuitiveness of the new delivery tracking interface. Additionally, I presented the design concepts during our Weekly Design Review Session, where team members provided valuable critique and suggestions for further refinement.

### 👨🏻‍🏫 Lesson Learned & Impact

The most significant learning experience emerged from the intricate process of analyzing and synthesizing the research data. As my first major user research undertaking, the challenge of transforming raw feedback into actionable insights proved to be particularly enlightening. The process of mapping complex user behaviors and preferences helped develop my analytical capabilities and strengthened my approach to user-centered design methodology.

This project delivered substantial measurable impact: customers experienced significantly improved visibility into their delivery timing, enabling them to plan their operations more effectively and reduce uncertainty in their daily workflows. This enhancement in service transparency manifested tangibly in our metrics, with a notable decrease in delivery-related inquiries to our Customer Service team, indicating that customers felt more informed and confident about their deliveries.
