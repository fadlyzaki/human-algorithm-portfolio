## 11. Interview Preparation

### Career Gap Script (90 seconds)

> "After Lumina, I made a deliberate choice to invest in myself. I pursued a Master's in Educational Technology — studying Cognitive Load Theory and how people actually learn. During that time, I also built my portfolio from scratch using AI-assisted workflows — React, design system tokens, bilingual support — which became a product in itself. I'm coming back with deeper thinking, sharper tools, and a clear direction."

### "Tell Me About Yourself" (2 minutes)

> "I'm Zaki — a product designer who designs trust into systems that serve people the economy forgot. I started at STOQO, digitizing Jakarta's food supply chain. I learned firsthand that logistics isn't about speed — it's about anxiety. Then at GudangAda, I designed the checkout and merchant tools for Indonesia's $100B FMCG marketplace — simplifying complex B2B transactions so warung owners felt as safe buying 5 million rupiah of stock as buying a cup of coffee. At Lumina, I designed a 'LinkedIn for blue-collar workers' — replacing intimidating resumes with voice notes and one-tap apply. I recently completed a Master's in Educational Technology, and my portfolio itself is a product — co-created with AI agents, featuring interactive case studies, a design system, and bilingual support. I'm looking for a role where I can bring that same rigor — making complex systems feel human."

### "Why This Company?" Formula

> "I'm drawn to [Company] because of [specific product / mission / article]. In my work at [relevant company], I tackled [similar challenge]. I believe my experience in [specific skill] would directly contribute to [their challenge], and I'm excited by [specific growth opportunity at the company]."
